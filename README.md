This R package was created to implement functions for calculating the probabilities of a Binomial random variable and related calculations.  Moreover, the package contains built in functions to allow the user to visualize probability distributions and cumulative distributions.

Here is a list of functions included in the package:
'''{r}
bin_var()
'''
bin_choose()
bin_probability()
bin_distribution()
bin_cumulative()
bin_mean()
bin_variance()
bin_mode()
bin_skewness()
bin_kurtosis()

## Motivation:

This package was created as part of a class project to learn the basic elements of creating an R package.
